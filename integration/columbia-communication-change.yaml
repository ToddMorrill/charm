  This container runs a change point detection system that uses a Hugging Face 
  sentiment classifier. Utterance level of predictions are then grouped into 8
  segment chunks and the average of the first 4 segment scores are compared to
  the last 4 segment scores. If these averages differ by a predefined threshold
  then the system produces a change point. The backend of this system is running
  on a hosted server with a GPU.
